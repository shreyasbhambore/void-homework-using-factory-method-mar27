# void-homework-using-factory-method-mar27



This code is a C++ program that defines some classes and interfaces, creates an instance of a class, calls its methods, and then deletes the instance. Here's a line-by-line explanation:

#include <iostream>

This line includes the iostream library, which provides input and output functionality in C++.

class InterfaceUnknown {

This line defines a class called InterfaceUnknown. This class has a public virtual function called QueryInterface, which takes a void** argument and an integer argument.

public:

This line declares the following member functions and variables as public.

virtual void QueryInterface(void** ppv, int i) = 0;

This line declares the QueryInterface function, which is a pure virtual function. This means that any class that inherits from InterfaceUnknown must implement this function.

};

This line ends the InterfaceUnknown class definition.

class IMobile : public InterfaceUnknown {

This line defines a class called IMobile that inherits from InterfaceUnknown. This class has a public virtual function called MakeCall, which takes no arguments and returns void.

public:

This line declares the following member functions and variables as public.

virtual void MakeCall() = 0;

This line declares the MakeCall function, which is a pure virtual function. This means that any class that inherits from IMobile must implement this function.

};

This line ends the IMobile class definition.

class ICalculator : public InterfaceUnknown {

This line defines a class called ICalculator that inherits from InterfaceUnknown. This class has a public virtual function called Add, which takes no arguments and returns void.

public:

This line declares the following member functions and variables as public.

virtual void Add() = 0;

This line declares the Add function, which is a pure virtual function. This means that any class that inherits from ICalculator must implement this function.

};

This line ends the ICalculator class definition.

class CMobile : public IMobile, public ICalculator {

This line defines a class called CMobile that inherits from both IMobile and ICalculator. This class has a public function called QueryInterface, which takes a void** argument and an integer argument. It also has public functions called MakeCall and Add, which override the corresponding functions in IMobile and ICalculator.

public:

This line declares the following member functions and variables as public.

void QueryInterface(void** ppv, int i) override {

This line defines the QueryInterface function. This function overrides the QueryInterface function in InterfaceUnknown. It takes a void** argument and an integer argument.

if (i == 1) {

This line checks if the integer argument is 1.

*ppv = (IMobile*)this;

This line sets the void** argument to a pointer to the IMobile part of the CMobile object.

}

This line ends the if statement.

else if (i == 2) {

This line checks if the integer argument is 2.

*ppv = (ICalculator*)this;

This line sets the void** argument to a pointer to the ICalculator part of the CMobile object.

}

This line ends the else if statement.

else {

This line executes

continue after this This line executes



*ppv = nullptr;

This line sets the void** argument to a null pointer if the integer argument is neither 1 nor 2.

}

This line ends the else statement.

}

This line ends the QueryInterface function.

void MakeCall() override {

This line defines the MakeCall function. This function overrides the MakeCall function in IMobile.

std::cout << "MakeCall() called" << std::endl;

This line prints the message "MakeCall() called" to the standard output.

}

This line ends the MakeCall function.

void Add() override {

This line defines the Add function. This function overrides the Add function in ICalculator.

std::cout << "Add() called" << std::endl;

This line prints the message "Add() called" to the standard output.

}

This line ends the Add function.

};

This line ends the CMobile class definition.

CMobile* CreateMobile() {

This line defines a function called CreateMobile. This function returns a pointer to a new CMobile object.

return new CMobile();

This line creates a new CMobile object and returns a pointer to it.

}

This line ends the CreateMobile function.

int main() {

This line defines the main function.

CMobile* mobile = CreateMobile();

This line creates a new CMobile object by calling the CreateMobile function and assigns the pointer to the mobile variable.

void* mobilePtr = nullptr;

This line initializes a void* variable called mobilePtr to nullptr.

void* calculatorPtr = nullptr;

This line initializes a void* variable called calculatorPtr to nullptr.

mobile->QueryInterface(&mobilePtr, 1);

This line calls the QueryInterface function of the CMobile object pointed to by mobile with the void** argument &mobilePtr and the integer argument 1.

mobile->QueryInterface(&calculatorPtr, 2);

This line calls the QueryInterface function of the CMobile object pointed to by mobile with the void** argument &calculatorPtr and the integer argument 2.

IMobile* mobileInterface = (IMobile*)mobilePtr;

This line creates a new IMobile* variable called mobileInterface and initializes it to the void* value pointed to by mobilePtr, which is cast to IMobile*.

ICalculator* calculatorInterface = (ICalculator*)calculatorPtr;

This line creates a new ICalculator* variable called calculatorInterface and initializes it to the void* value pointed to by calculatorPtr, which is cast to ICalculator*.

mobileInterface->MakeCall();

This line calls the MakeCall function of the IMobile object pointed to by mobileInterface.

calculatorInterface->Add();

This line calls the Add function of the ICalculator object pointed to by calculatorInterface.

delete mobile;

This line deletes the CMobile object pointed to by mobile.

return 0;

This line returns 0 to indicate successful program execution.

}

This line ends the main function.
